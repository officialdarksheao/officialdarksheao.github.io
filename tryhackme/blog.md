For this instance, let's do something a little different. You never know what system you will be having to deal with or what tools will be available, so instead of relying on the tools and pre-built systems I normally do, I'm going to set up a fresh virtual machine and go through the process until having this room completed.

# Virtual Machine Setup
Just in case we don't have a VM, let's go an get one.

## Download Linux
Since I've never messed with Arch Linux, I'm using Manjaro this time.
[Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org/)

## Download VirtualBox
Virtualbox is a decent option, so I'm going with that for this exercise.
[Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

Also grabbing the extension pack while I'm at it.
After installing, don't forget to install the extension pack.

## Build a VM

Launch VirtualBox and select "New" from the top menu.

We know we are building for Manjaro, which is Arch linux.

The hardware you are running will make an impact on how you set up the RAM allocation, personally I like to have a minimum of 4g

We need a hard drive, so create a virtual disk now.

VTI format is fine for this, and to keep your system clean, dynamically allocated is a good choice.
I'll run with 64g for my drive so we can have some room to play.

We do need to put our manjaro iso into our virtual disk drive, so let's go into our Manjaro machine's settings

From here go into the storage tab, then for the disk drive select to "choose a disk file"

Now we can launch our machine and begin the install process.
