# Welcome!

This is a static site for hosting writeup documents as I progress through various training and projects. Zero commitment on regularity or complexity, or even coherence. Have fun!

> Who I am:
> Professionally a software engineer and hacker by hobby, both in the digital way and in the tinkering together of things in the real.
